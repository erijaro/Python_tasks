# Task: Campaign Analysis

## Overview

This analysis focuses on assessing a campaign from two primary angles:

1. **Delivery of the Campaign - Where were Impressions served?**
   We aim to understand the distribution of Impressions across various platforms or sites.

2. **Performance - How did People Interact with the Creatives?**
   We seek insights into how users engaged with the campaign's creative materials.

## Key Questions

To achieve our analysis goals, we will explore the following key questions:

- **Performance Segments**:
  - Identify the best and worst-performing segments within the campaign.

- **Segment Combinations**:
  - Determine which combinations of segments resulted in the highest and lowest performance levels.

- **Interesting Segments/Trends**:
  - Highlight the most interesting segments or trends observed during the campaign analysis.

- **Inferences and Deductions**:
  - Make inferences or deductions based on the data analysis. What can we learn from the campaign's performance?

- **Recommendations**:
  - Suggest recommendations for future campaigns or propose further analyses to enhance campaign performance.

- **Assumptions**:
  - Clearly outline any assumptions made during the analysis to provide context for the findings.
